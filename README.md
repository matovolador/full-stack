# FlaskInit Sample
### Master Coverage
[![Coverage Status](./coverage-badge.svg?dummy=8484744)](./coverage.xml) 
* This generated by master's `./deploy.sh` script. The files are pulled out of the docker containers after deployment and tests have ran.
### Dev Coverage
[![Coverage Status](./web/coverage-badge.svg?dummy=8484744)](./web/coverage.xml) 
* This is generated by dev branch's `./web/coverageme.sh` script. Its a local execution of the flask app against the a local docker "db" container. See more about this under '"Dev" Usage'
## Description
This repo is basically a flask application that contains unittests, ORM, migrations, and full docker integration as a sample project.
It's basic project structure, with best development practices containing a full suite of automatic deployment, unittests and coverage that is ran automatically whenever the docker images are deployed.

## Requirements
* docker
* docker-compose
* this was done under WSL2: ubuntu-20
* python3.6+
* venv module
* you need to create your virtual environment under ./web/venv for all scripts to work.

## Usage
Deployment of all images (nginx reverse proxy, postgres DB and flask API) are done with `./deploy.sh`. This script also executes unittests and database migrations. Also copies results of coverage scan into the actual project root folder so it can be displayed in the README.md badge, and analyzed in pull requests if so required.
The Flask API itself comes with some base routes and some basic stuff to get you started quickly into adding more routes. It also comes with unittests, codecoverage, and alembic database migrations and SQL_Alchemy
The structure is made so that you include all your custom classes inside the modules folder, and all your "execute" files inside the bin folder.

## "Dev" Usage
If you are using the dev branch for local test and development:
1) Deploy database: `$ docker-compose up --build -d db`
2) Go into `web` folder
3) Run app: 
    * `$ source venv/bin/activate`
    * `$ python __init__.py`
4) Run tests and coverage:
`$ ./coverageme.sh`

### Migrations, Unittests and Code Coverage
Migrations, unit tests and code coverage badges and analysis are all executed automatically by the deploy script: `./deploy.sh`
If you wish to get rid of the database alterations that were made by alembic, just run `alembic downgrade base` using the web/venv/bin/python interpreter and you can then remove the revisions from their folder, and start writing your own models inside `./web/modules/database.py`. Please refer to Alembic documentation on how to create revisions and use migration commands.

## TODOs
* Need to add more info on how docker was implemented
